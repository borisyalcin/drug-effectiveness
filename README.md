# Drug Effectiveness Analysis

## Objective
* To analyze the performance of Capomulin, a drug developed by Pymaceuticals Inc., in treating squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in mice, and to compare its efficacy with other treatment regimens. This analysis involves generating comprehensive tables and figures that summarize the results of a 45-day study involving 250 mice, to support the technical report and provide a top-level summary for the executive team.

* The analysis included generating tables and figures that detailed the tumor size progression, survival rates, and statistical significance of the results. The key findings were:

#### Tumor Size Reduction: 
Mice treated with Capomulin showed a significant reduction in tumor size compared to those treated with other regimens.
#### Survival Rates: 
The survival rate of mice under the Capomulin regimen was higher than those under other treatments.
#### Statistical Significance: 
The results were statistically significant, demonstrating Capomulin's effectiveness in reducing tumor growth and improving survival rates.

These findings support the potential of Capomulin as a viable treatment option for SCC and provide a strong foundation for further research and development. The detailed tables and figures generated will be included in the technical report to provide a comprehensive overview of the study's outcomes.

## Observations and Insights
* The correlation coefficient between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen is 0.84 which helps us to understand that our calculations are correct and there is a strong relationship between the relative movements of two variables.

* The population of male mice is slightly higher than several females. However, we need more data and analysis to figure out which drug regimen is more effective on which gender.

* Based on this data, Capomulin seems to be the clear winner in terms of efficacy at reducing tumor size
